title: Creating a NiFi image
---

In this session we will create a basic Apache NiFi image and deploy it to HPE Container Platform.

We do NOT need the kubedirector-lab in this session.

### Functionality Walkthrough

After following this lesson you will have a NiFi tile in your list of Applications:

![NiFi Tile](/img/nifi_tile.png)

If you select the Service Endpoints menu, you should see a http endpoint: 

![NiFi Service](/img/nifi_service.png)

If you select the link for the http endpoint, you should see a NiFi page:

![NiFi Link](/img/nifi_link.png)

:::info

If you see a HTTP 503 error wait a few minutes for the NiFi service to start and then try again.

You should then see the NiFi canvas:
